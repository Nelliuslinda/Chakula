Chakula is a e-commerce website that allows users to order food online. It has two sections; Admin and User.
The admin section allows the adminstator to view the users of the website as well as make changes to the website such as editing the menu.
The user section is where the cutomer makes an order and is able to pay online and receive a confirmation

Still working on adding an Mpesa API :)
